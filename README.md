# VSTS Process Template Manager [![Visual Studio Marketplace](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version-short/nkdagility.processtemplate.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nkdagility.processtemplate)

This task automates the Process of managing your Process Template changes from source control to VSTS so that you can keep all your projects in sync. 

One of the largest issues for Enterprise is everyone using a different process template for their projects. When you move your Collection to VSTS with your custom Process Template you get a "Phase 1 enabled account". This account does not let you edit the Process Template in the UI and instead lets you download and upload the process template.

This Build Task lets you upload a local template into VSTS.


## What can you do with this tool?

- Upload XML Based Process Template
